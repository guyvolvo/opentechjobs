# Runs the fast re-poll cycle on an EventBridge schedule, replacing

# infra-apply time, no probe.py/loader/requests. deploy-scrape-lambda.yml
# (GitHub Actions) ships the real package via `aws lambda update-function-code`,

  # Unlike the API Lambda's placeholder (which zips the whole real api/

  # probe.py/loader/requests, since Terraform's archive_file can't run
  # pip. A later `terraform apply` picking up on that hash difference
  # would silently overwrite deploy-scrape-lambda.yml's real deployed
  # code with a build missing probe.py entirely, breaking every
  # scheduled run until the next code push -- happened once already
  # (2026-09-04). ignore_changes makes code exclusively the deploy
  # workflow's, matching the intent above, not just the placeholder
  # zip's initial-create purpose.
